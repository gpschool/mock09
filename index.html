<p>A summary of many of the lessons learnt through this workshop and other meetings is available in the following paper</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6251">Kernels for Vector Valued Functions</a> by Mauricio Alvarez, Lorenzo Rosasco and Neil D. Lawrence</p>

<p>Also published by Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning</p>

<p>Accounting for dependencies between outputs has important
applications in several areas. In sensor networks, for  example,
missing signals from temporal failing sensors may be predicted due to
correlations with signals acquired from other sensors. In
geo-statistics, prediction of the concentration of heavy pollutant
metals (for example, Copper  concentration), that require expensive
procedures to be measured, can be done using inexpensive and
oversampled variables (for example, pH data).

<p>Multi-task learning is a general learning framework in which it is
assumed that learning multiple tasks simultaneously leads to better
modeling results and performance that learning the same tasks
individually. Exploiting correlations and dependencies among tasks, it
becomes possible to handle common practical situations such as missing
data or to increase the amount of potential data when only few amount
of data per task is available.

<p>In this workshop we will consider the use of kernel methods for
multiple outputs and multi-task learning. The aim of the workshop is to
bring together Bayesian and frequentist researchers to establish
common ground and shared goals.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

In the last few years there has been an increasing amount of work on
Multi-task Learning. Hierarchical Bayesian approaches and neural
networks have been proposed. More recently, the Gaussian Processes framework has been
considered, where the correlations among tasks can be captured by
appropriate choices of covariance functions.  Many of these choices
have been inspired by the geo-statistics literature, in which a
similar area is known as <i>cokriging</i>. In the frequentist
perspective, regularization theory has provided a natural framework to
deal with multi-task problems: assumptions on the relation of the
different tasks translate into the design of suitable regularizers.
Despite the common traits of the proposed approaches, so far different
communities have worked independently.  For example it is natural to
ask whether the proposed choices of the covariance function can be
interpreted from a regularization perspective.  Or, in turn, if each
regularizer induces a specific form of the covariance/kernel function.
By bringing together the latest advances from both communities, we aim
at establishing what is the state of the art and the possible future
challenges in the context of multiple-task learning.


<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>This workshop will be a venue for researchers coming from Bayesian and
frequentist perspectives to discuss differences and common aspects between
the different approaches as well as to to gain insights on the common
fundamental principles  underlying multiple-task learning.
The workshop will  be of interest for both theoreticians and practitioners.
